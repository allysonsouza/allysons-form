# Allysons Form
Plugin for form creation in front and back end responding as theme and plugin responsibilities - Plugin Territory

## Description

Not a contact form 7!

This plugin was born from a presentation by [Allyson Souza](https://profiles.wordpress.org/allysonsouza) about [Plugins Territory](https://2018.portoalegre.wordcamp.org/session/plugin-territory-o-que-e-responsabilidade-de-temas-e-o-que-e-responsabilidade-dos-plugins/#more-888) in the 2018 WordCamp POA. The idea is to demonstrate the creation of forms that run as plugins, respecting the concept of shared responsibilities, but giving freedom to modify the HTML structure and CSS styles from the theme, how it should be!

Plugin takes care of business rules and logic while the theme takes care of the visual part.
